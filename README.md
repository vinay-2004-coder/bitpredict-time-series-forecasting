# BitPredict — Bitcoin Time Series Forecasting

## Overview
End-to-end time series forecasting project focused on predicting Bitcoin prices using TensorFlow.
The project demonstrates windowing, model training, evaluation, and future forecasting.

## Dataset
- Historical Bitcoin price data
- Time series formatted using sliding windows

## Approach
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Window-based time series modeling
- Deep learning models built with TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluation using regression metrics
- Visualization of predictions and future forecasts

## How to Run
### Google Colab
Upload the notebook and run it top-to-bottom.

### Local
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
